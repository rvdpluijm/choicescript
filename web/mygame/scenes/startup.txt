It 's the beginning of a new year as you enter the doorsteps of the company you became familiar with the past few years. Crossing this particular doorstep on the first day of the year always seems to remind you of the first steps of your professional career. Already five years ago, you graduated from the art academy. Excited, you started your career as a(n) ...

		Fully focussed on getting to know the right people, you score high points with Sean, your boss. You actually arranged to be a regular on his weekly Wednesday night's poker game. Since Sean also recognizes the importance of networking, this brings you in contact with a lot of inspiring CEOs of other companies in the creative industry.	
		*line_break 
		On your left, there's Matt Sanders, the CEO and founder of [i]Blue Creations[/i], a small venture specialised in creative sustainable solutions. He is a small, Caucasian man with a solemn look on his face.
		*line_break 
		Next to him sits Jeff Slim, a middle-aged man with a small goatee. According to Sean, he is the Lead Designer of Rooklyn Industries, a successful design firm aimed at governmental institutes such as universities and ministries and employing a diverse type of employee, from designers to philosophers, from psychologists to IT-nerds.	
		*line_break 
		Then comes Sean, your boss. He seems quite focussed on his current game and doesn't pay much attention to the chitchat you are having with the other guests. 
		*line_break 
		Last, there is Ellen Boung, CEO of Olivyg, one of last years winner of the Effies in advertising. A rather large business man who seems quite full of himself. A giant in advertising, but he esures you'll get your share of your own profession also. He can use all the creative minds he can get to satisfy his customers. 
		*line_break

		Over the course of the evening, you get to chat with all of the other guests and they seem to be more than politely interested in your work. If you are willing, you can choose to switch your career.

				Apparently, Sean was eavesdropping on you, since afterwards, he asks you to stay for a bit. [i]Well, well, well... You've got yourself quite some offers there. That wasn't what I expected to happen, honestly. Have you already decided what you're going to do?[/i]

Because of the excellent work you delivered, Sean decides you may take some time to work on a project of your own interest. Naturally, this should be something you are able to excel in while still being something new. [i]" I still expect the best from you, of course. And if I say 'something new', I mean something which will help ${cmpname} in any way you can imagine. I hope you'll enjoy yourself with this. You do know I'm not giving such an opportunity to every guy or gal here, now do you? So I expect the very best from you. And it should be your creation... not just some copy cat of one of your colleagues. I know you can do it!."[/i]

Did that just sound as a motivating speech?

Anyhow, do you remember how you interpreted Sean's assignment? In what creative way did you try to help ${cmpname} forward? Note that, while you may try something that is completely outside of your comfort zone, the risk you have of failing will be higher, but the rewards will be bigger.

				That sounds a bit at odd with the principles of design fiction, now doesn't it? After all, design fiction seems to be a form of hyperbolic criticism, which requires you to emphasize that which you would like to criticise. In that sense, it works more or less like a magnifying glass, which, in your case, doesn't seem to be looking at any spot at all.
