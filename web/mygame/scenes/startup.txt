It 's the beginning of a new year as you enter the doorsteps of the company you became familiar with the past few years. Crossing this particular doorstep on the first day of the year always seems to remind you of the first steps of your professional career. Already five years ago, you graduated from the art academy. Excited, you started your career as a(n) ...

As you enter your office, you still ponder about the past years and what they brought you. You were quite young back then, fresh from the academy and not as used to working at ${cmpname}. Naturally, you wanted to get a better in ${studie_richting}, but perhaps you had other thoughts about what work should be about. After all, as the saying goes, do you [i]work to live[/i] or rather [i]live to work[/i]? In other words, what was your focus during your first years?

		Fully focussed on getting to know the right people, you score high points with Sean, your boss. You actually arranged to be a regular on his weekly Wednesday night's poker game. Since Sean also recognizes the importance of networking, this brings you in contact with a lot of inspiring CEOs of other companies in the creative industry.	
		*line_break 
		On your left, there's Matt Sanders, the CEO and founder of [i]Blue Creations[/i], a small venture specialised in creative sustainable solutions. He is a small, Caucasian man with a solemn look on his face.
		*line_break 
		Next to him sits Jeff Slim, a middle-aged man with a small goatee. According to Sean, he is the Lead Designer of Rooklyn Industries, a successful design firm aimed at governmental institutes such as universities and ministries and employing a diverse type of employee, from designers to philosophers, from psychologists to IT-nerds.	
		*line_break 
		Then comes Sean, your boss. He seems quite focussed on his current game and doesn't pay much attention to the chitchat you are having with the other guests. 
		*line_break 
		Last, there is Giles Boung, CEO of Olivyg, one of last years winner of the Effies in advertising. A rather large business man who seems quite full of himself. A giant in advertising, but he esures you'll get your share of your own profession also. He can use all the creative minds he can get to satisfy his customers. 
		*line_break 
		*line_break 
		Over the course of the evening, you get to chat with all of the other guests and they seem to be more than politely interested in your work. If you are willing, you can choose to switch your career. 
		*choice
			#Nah, I'm fine with my current choice.
				Apparently, Sean was eavesdropping on you, since afterwards, he asks you to stay for a bit. [i]Well, well, well... You've got yourself quite some offers there. That wasn't what I expected to happen, honestly. Have you already decided what you're going to do?[/i]
				*fake_choice
					#I like the challenges of my job...
					#I like my colleagues, so I'm gonna stay.
					#If I get a raise, I would be even more motivated to stay...
